Dear Sir/Madam
Thank you very much for your kind remind and enthusiasm.
I am very honored and happy to serve our SciencePG as Lead Guest Editor of our Special Issue 147012 entitled “Some Novel Algorithms for Global Optimization and Relevant Subjects” of Applied and Computational Mathematics Journal available at http://www.sciencepublishinggroup.com/specialissue/147012.

After receiving review results from my Editorial Board, I accept the manuscript ACM_147012013 entitled "Using structure holes for determining key factors: an illustration of reporting eradication of amoebiasis" published in the issue 147012. The manuscript needs to be re-format according to SciencePG template. The conclusion is too short and so authors can merge it to the discussion section. Authors should number all sections. In general, this experimental research (structure hole) is very good and useful in epidemiology.

I will try my best to call for papers and complete more papers.
Please keep in touch with me.
Best regards,
