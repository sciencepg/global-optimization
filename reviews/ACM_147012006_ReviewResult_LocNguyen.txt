4
The main contribution of this research is to make a comparison between Singular Perturbations Approximation (SPA) method and meta-heuristic techniques (PSO and SFLA) for order reduction of discrete linear systems. Author also make numerical simulation on the comparison.

Brief comments of other editor:
Some algorithms are presented comparative examples in the article. However, such a comparison is expected to give better results SFLA algorithm, PSO algorithm appears to be better. Strengths: It understands how to respond algorithms when applied to some systems. Weaknesses: Already PSO and the GA is well known, is expected to give better results SFLA algorithm, but it is not.

13. Please provide detailed suggestions on how to improve the paper

Followings are comments on enhancing the manuscripts:
- Author should improve the section 2.1 with more explanations. For example, please describes shortly quantities Ar, Br, Cr.


14. Minor comments (if any)
4
- Please follow SciencePG template.
- Section 2.1 should be improved because it is the most important one this this survey research. The connection between SPA (matrices) and order reduction (z-transfer function) should be mentioned explicitly.
- Author stated that "However, compared to PSA method, the transient responses of evolutionary reduced model by PSO and SFLA are very close to that of original model". However, the table 3 indicates that PSO and SPA are closer to original model (especially, from 0 to 10).
- Author should mention SPA method in the conclusion section.

The attached includes some corrections in your paper. Please use SciencePG template.


16. Overall Evaluation:
4
The article is well written in general. However, there are some deficiencies. For example, matrixes A111 and A211 (in equations 16 and 18) should be clearly stated step by step. In other words, section 2.1 should be improved with more explanations.
