Dear Sir/Madam
Thank you very much for your kind remind and enthusiasm.
I am very honored and happy to serve our SciencePG as Lead Guest Editor of our Special Issue 147012 entitled “Some Novel Algorithms for Global Optimization and Relevant Subjects” of Applied and Computational Mathematics Journal available at http://www.sciencepublishinggroup.com/specialissue/147012.

After receiving review results from my Editorial Board, I accept the manuscript ACM_147012012 entitled "Mobile Online Computer-Adaptive Tests (CAT) for Gathering Patient Feedback on Doctor-Patient and Doctor-Family Interaction of the quality of patient care in Pediatric Consultations" published in the issue 147012.
Although the research does not match exactly to relevant subjects in the issue, the Rasch model is analytic function with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method. The manuscript needs to be re-format according to SciencePG template. The conclusion is too short and so authors can merge it to the discussion section. Authors should number all sections. In general, this is an excellent experimental research.

I will try my best to call for papers and complete more papers.
Please keep in touch with me.
Best regards,
