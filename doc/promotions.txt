----------Group Invitation----------
Subject: Invitation to join the group "Global Optimization"
From: Loc Nguyen <ng_phloc@yahoo.com>

Dear Researcher/Scholar/Professor/Scientist,
Your expertise in science is appreciated very much.
I kindly invite you to join the group "Global Optimization".

We always try our best to create best results but how we can do so? Mathematical optimization is a good answer for above question if our problems can be modeled by mathematical model. The common model is analytic function and it is very easy for us to know that optimization becomes finding out extreme points of such function. The group focuses on global optimization which means that how to find out the global peak over the whole function. It is very interesting problem because there are two realistic cases as follows:
- We want to get the best solution and there is no one better than this solution.
- Given a good solution, we want to get another better solution.
However, global optimization is also complicated because it is relevant to other mathematical subject such as solution existence and approximation. The group also mentions these subjects. Algorithms and applied methods to solve problem of global optimization are appreciated.
The group is associated with the Special Issue entitled “Some Novel Algorithms for Global Optimization and Relevant Subjects” in the journal of “Applied and Computational Mathematics” [ISSN: 2328-5605 (Print), 2328-5613 (Online)], a peer-reviewed journal of Science Publishing Group.

In other words, you are also author, reviewer, and editor within this Special Issue.

As member of this group, you are encouraged in sharing your professional knowledge and experiences, submitting your manuscripts, enjoying new articles and book, etc. Moreover you are warmly invited to review other members' articles as a reviewer/editor.

Your knowledge, experiences, and contributions are very important and necessary for our group to be successful.
